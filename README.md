# NLP-and-Transformers-Huggingface

In this lesson, I learn how to approach different NLP tasks using the high-level pipeline() function from ðŸ¤— Transformers. You also saw how to search for and use models in the Hub, as well as how to use the Inference API to test the models directly in your browser.

And they also discussed how Transformer models work at a high level, and talked about the importance of transfer learning and fine-tuning. A key aspect is that you can use the full architecture or only the encoder or decoder, depending on what kind of task you aim to solve.
